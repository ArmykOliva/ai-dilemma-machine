Whene developing frontend, use 
- tailwind styling
- lucid icons - DONT USE EMOJIS, just icons
- Shadcn components as building blocks (ALWAYS use the ShadCN MCP when working with components)
- zustand to handle states of frontend (we should always load data into a state and then only render the state. so we basically have api->state json->frontend rendering)
- use framer for animations, always animate stuff nicely
- frontend is already running through docker compose. never start it yourself! Never touch docker compose!!!!!!!!!
- use the playwright mcp or the webbrowser to look at the website to test your new features or style out automatically
- when interfacing with api, always look into src/types/api.d.ts - it is the openai typsescrpt configuration of the backend
- always translate all text to the src/i18n/locales
- web is running at localhost:3000
